[Annotation and quantification of poly(A) sites](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/D1/D174/5588346#190995771)

As each 3′ end read originated in one transcript, we calculated the ‘abundance’ of each poly(A) site in each sample as S_i^u=S_i^n/N^S⋅10^6 (transcripts per million, TPM), where nSi is the number of reads from sample S ending at site i and NS is the total number of reads from sample S that contributed to the atlas. The abundance of a cluster was calculated as the sum of abundances of all sites in the cluster. We also estimated the relative usage of a cluster within the corresponding gene by dividing its abundance to the total abundance of all clusters located within the gene.
